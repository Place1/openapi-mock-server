- timestamps need to be legit
 - i.e. use the “format” key from the spec
 - https://swagger.io/docs/specification/data-models/data-types/
- enum should work
- array length default length (config value)
- strings should be random per request
 - perhaps a config value between generate once and per request
- default format flags
 - min and max values for ints and floats
- act as a proxy and record request/responses to overrides.yaml file
- act as a validation proxy
 - validate request and responses match the schema
